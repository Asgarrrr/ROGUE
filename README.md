# ROGUE

A school project.

Rogue is a challenging roguelike game where you become a hero trying to complete
the floors of the dungeon, starting at sewers and going deeper and deeper
until you'll reach the caves and their demonic enemies.

Here are some of its features:

 * Procedurally generated levels (every run is unique)
 * Permadeath
 * Three unique classes of hero
 * Endless floors of increasing difficulty
 * More than 25 different enemies with their own quirks
 * ASCII Art style
